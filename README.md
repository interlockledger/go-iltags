# InterlockLedger ILTag for Go

## Description

This is the implementation of **InterlockLedger** **ILTag** for **Go**. For more information, see
the [specification of IL2](https://github.com/interlockledger/specification/tree/master).

## Minimum Go Version

This library was written using **Go** 1.18 without the use of 
[Generics](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md). 
Because of that, we believe that this library will
work with older versions of **Go** but we do not plan to officially provide
support for older versions of **Go** in this project.

## Dependencies

This library has been developed to run without any external dependencies aside for the
Go standard library with the exception of [Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
that is used to implement the unit tests.

## Documentation

The documentation of this library can be easily generated using **godoc**.

## License

This library is licensed under a 3-Clause BSD license.
