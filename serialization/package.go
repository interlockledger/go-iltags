This package implements the serialization primitives used to serialize the tags.

Although the standard library package binary can perform most of the tasks
inside this package we decided to go for a more explicit approach when dealing
with this API.

Furthermore, this API is designed to be as strict as possible regarding the data
formats because it is expected to be used to deal with signed data.
